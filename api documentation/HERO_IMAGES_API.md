# Hero Images API — Frontend Integration Guide

**Audience:** Unilake frontend team
**Last updated:** July 27, 2026
**Source of truth:** [src/routes/admin.ts](src/routes/admin.ts), [src/routes/public.ts](src/routes/public.ts), [src/controllers/heroImage.controller.ts](src/controllers/heroImage.controller.ts), [src/services/heroImage.service.ts](src/services/heroImage.service.ts), [src/validators/heroImage.schema.ts](src/validators/heroImage.schema.ts), [src/lib/r2.ts](src/lib/r2.ts)

> Read the announcement guide ([ANNOUNCEMENTS_API.md](ANNOUNCEMENTS_API.md)) first if you haven't — §3 (response envelope) and §4 (admin auth) there apply identically here and are only summarized below. **What's genuinely new in this module is the two-step direct-to-R2 file upload (§5).** That's the part that will cost you time if you skim it.

## 1. What a hero image is

The large banner images in the homepage hero carousel. That is the entire feature — an image URL and an on/off flag. There is **no** title, subtitle, caption, alt text, CTA link, button label, target page, or scheduling window on this model. If the design calls for text or a link over the banner, that copy must be baked into the image itself or hardcoded in the frontend; the API will not supply it.

A single hero image is:

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | `string` (UUID v4) | Server-generated. |
| `imageUrl` | `string` | **Fully-qualified public URL**, ready to drop into `<img src>`. Not a key, not a path — no need to prefix anything. |
| `isActive` | `boolean` | Only `true` rows appear on the public endpoint. **Defaults to `true` on create** — see the warning in §6.2. |
| `createdAt` | `string` (ISO 8601) | Also the sort key. |
| `updatedAt` | `string` (ISO 8601) | Auto-bumped on write. |

Schema: [prisma/schema.prisma:487-495](prisma/schema.prisma#L487-L495)

### Deliberate absences — do not go looking for these endpoints

| Missing | Reality |
|---|---|
| `sortOrder` / reorder endpoint | **Ordering is `createdAt` descending — newest first, always.** Unlike announcements, there is no manual ordering. To move a banner to the front of the carousel, the admin must delete it and re-upload. Make sure the admin UI communicates this. |
| `PATCH /hero-images/:id` | **There is no update endpoint at all.** You cannot swap the image or edit anything on an existing row. "Replace this banner" = delete + upload new. |
| Alt text | Not stored. Generate something from context (`Unilake hero banner 1`) or accept the a11y gap knowingly. |
| Link / CTA target | Not stored. Hardcode on the frontend. |

---

## 2. Base URLs

| Environment | Base URL |
|---|---|
| Local dev | `http://localhost:8080` |
| Deployed (Cloud Run) | `https://unilake-backend-590672762351.asia-south1.run.app` |

CORS currently allows **only** `http://localhost:3000` ([src/app.ts:32](src/app.ts#L32)). Give backend your deploy URL when you have one.

---

## 3. Response envelope (recap)

Success (except `204`): `{ "success": true, "data": <payload> }`
Error: `{ "success": false, "error": { "code": "...", "message": "..." } }`
`DELETE` returns bare **`204` with an empty body** — never call `res.json()` on it.

Error codes you'll see here: `VALIDATION_ERROR` (400), `UNAUTHORIZED` (401), `FORBIDDEN` (403), `NOT_FOUND` (404), `INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR` (500).

---

## 4. Admin access (recap)

Everything under `/api/admin/*` runs through `requireAdmin`: no valid Better Auth session → `401`; valid session but `role !== "ADMIN"` → `403`.

**No bearer token. Auth is an httpOnly cookie.** Every admin call needs `credentials: "include"` (fetch) or `withCredentials: true` (axios). Gate the admin UI on `role === "ADMIN"` from `GET /api/auth/get-session`.

| Endpoint | Guard |
|---|---|
| `GET /api/public/hero-images` | 🟢 **None** |
| `POST /api/admin/hero-images/upload-url` | 🔒 Admin |
| `POST /api/admin/hero-images` | 🔒 Admin |
| `GET /api/admin/hero-images` | 🔒 Admin |
| `PATCH /api/admin/hero-images/:id/status` | 🔒 Admin |
| `DELETE /api/admin/hero-images/:id` | 🔒 Admin |

---

## 5. ⭐ The upload flow — the important part

Images do **not** pass through the Unilake backend. The browser uploads the file **directly to Cloudflare R2** using a short-lived presigned URL. Three steps:

```
┌─────────┐  1. POST /admin/hero-images/upload-url   ┌─────────┐
│         │  { fileName, contentType }               │ Unilake │
│ Browser │ ───────────────────────────────────────► │ backend │
│         │ ◄─────────────────────────────────────── │         │
│         │       { uploadUrl, key }                 └─────────┘
│         │
│         │  2. PUT <uploadUrl>   (raw file bytes)   ┌─────────┐
│         │ ───────────────────────────────────────► │   R2    │
│         │ ◄─────────────────────────────────────── │ bucket  │
│         │              200 OK                      └─────────┘
│         │
│         │  3. POST /admin/hero-images              ┌─────────┐
│         │  { imageKey: key }                       │ Unilake │
│         │ ───────────────────────────────────────► │ backend │
│         │ ◄─────────────────────────────────────── │         │
└─────────┘   201 { id, imageUrl, isActive, ... }    └─────────┘
```

**Step 2 does not create a database row.** Until step 3 runs, the file sits in the bucket and no hero image exists. If the user closes the tab between 2 and 3, you get an orphaned file in R2 that nothing references (harmless, but it's dead storage).

### Step 5.1 — `POST /api/admin/hero-images/upload-url`

**Request body:**

```json
{
  "fileName": "homepage-banner-diwali.webp",
  "contentType": "image/webp"
}
```

| Field | Type | Required | Rules |
|---|---|---|---|
| `fileName` | `string` | ✅ | Min 1 char. Send `file.name` straight from the `<input type="file">`. The server sanitizes it (`[^a-zA-Z0-9.-]` → `_`) and prefixes a UUID, so collisions are impossible and you don't need to make it unique. Spaces and unicode are fine — they just get replaced. |
| `contentType` | `string` | ✅ | Must match `^image/(png\|jpeg\|jpg\|webp)$`. Send `file.type` from the File object. |

**Allowed MIME types — exactly four:** `image/png`, `image/jpeg`, `image/jpg`, `image/webp`.

> ⚠️ **Rejected: `image/gif`, `image/avif`, `image/svg+xml`, `image/heic`.** HEIC matters — photos straight off an iPhone are `image/heic` and will 400. If the admin panel might receive one, either convert client-side before upload or show a clear "PNG, JPEG or WEBP only" message.
>
> Note `image/jpg` is accepted by the regex, but browsers report `image/jpeg` for `.jpg` files. Just forward `file.type` and it will be correct.

**Response `200`:**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "uploadUrl": "https://<account>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/unilake-public/hero-images/6f2b1a90-...-homepage-banner-diwali.webp?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=...&X-Amz-Expires=900&X-Amz-Signature=...",
    "key": "hero-images/6f2b1a90-4c77-4d1e-9f0a-2b8e5c1d7a33-homepage-banner-diwali.webp"
  }
}
```

- `uploadUrl` — presigned `PUT` target. **Valid for 15 minutes** ([heroImage.service.ts:7](src/services/heroImage.service.ts#L7)). Single-use in practice; never log it or persist it (the signature is a credential).
- `key` — hold onto this. It is the exact string you must send in step 3.

**Errors:**

| Status | Message |
|---|---|
| 400 | `"Validation failed - contentType: Only PNG, JPEG, and WEBP images are allowed"` |
| 400 | `"Validation failed - fileName: File name is required"` |
| 401 / 403 | See §4 |

---

### Step 5.2 — `PUT` the file to R2

This request goes to **Cloudflare, not to us.** Getting it wrong is the #1 source of lost time in this flow, so read every bullet:

```js
const res = await fetch(uploadUrl, {
  method: "PUT",                          // PUT — not POST
  headers: { "Content-Type": file.type }, // MUST equal the contentType you sent in step 1
  body: file,                             // raw File/Blob — NOT FormData
});
if (!res.ok) throw new Error("Upload to R2 failed");
```

**The four ways this goes wrong:**

1. **`Content-Type` mismatch → `403 SignatureDoesNotMatch`.** The content type is baked into the signature ([r2.ts:129](src/lib/r2.ts#L129)). If you asked for `image/webp` and PUT with `image/png` — or let the browser default it — R2 rejects the request. Use the *same variable* for both calls, don't retype the string.
2. **Wrapping the file in `FormData` → corrupt image.** A presigned PUT takes the raw bytes as the body. `FormData` adds multipart boundary junk that becomes part of the stored file. Pass the `File` object directly.
3. **Sending `credentials: "include"` or an `Authorization` header → `400`/`403`.** Do **not** reuse your authenticated API client for this call. The R2 request is authorized entirely by the query-string signature; cookies and auth headers can conflict with it. Use a bare `fetch`/`XMLHttpRequest`.
4. **Taking longer than 15 minutes** (user picks a file, wanders off, then submits) → `403`. See tip §8.2.

**Success is `200` with an empty body.** There is nothing to parse. R2 errors come back as **XML**, not JSON — if you need the detail, read `await res.text()`.

---

### Step 5.3 — `POST /api/admin/hero-images`

**Request body:**

```json
{
  "imageKey": "hero-images/6f2b1a90-4c77-4d1e-9f0a-2b8e5c1d7a33-homepage-banner-diwali.webp"
}
```

| Field | Type | Required | Rules |
|---|---|---|---|
| `imageKey` | `string` | ✅ | Min 1 char. Must be the **exact `key`** returned in step 5.1. |

> ⚠️ **The server does not verify that the key exists in R2.** It blindly concatenates it onto the public base URL and saves the row. Send a typo, a truncated key, or the full `uploadUrl` instead of the `key`, and you get a `201 Created` with a permanently broken image. Pass the `key` value through untouched — never rebuild it by hand, never substring it, never strip the `hero-images/` prefix.

Server behavior: `imageUrl = <R2 public base>/<imageKey>`, and `isActive` is set to **`true`** by the DB default.

**Response `201`:**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "id": "c4e91f07-3b52-4a8d-95c1-7d0f6b2e4a19",
    "imageUrl": "https://cdn.unilake.example/hero-images/6f2b1a90-4c77-4d1e-9f0a-2b8e5c1d7a33-homepage-banner-diwali.webp",
    "isActive": true,
    "createdAt": "2026-07-27T10:22:41.660Z",
    "updatedAt": "2026-07-27T10:22:41.660Z"
  }
}
```

**Errors:** `400 VALIDATION_ERROR` (`"Validation failed - imageKey: Image key is required"`), `401`, `403`.

---

## 6. Endpoint reference

### 6.1 `GET /api/public/hero-images` — the carousel feed

Returns **only active** hero images, sorted **`createdAt` descending (newest first)**.

**Auth:** none. **Query params:** none — no pagination, no limit. **Body:** none.

**Response `200`:**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "c4e91f07-3b52-4a8d-95c1-7d0f6b2e4a19",
      "imageUrl": "https://cdn.unilake.example/hero-images/6f2b1a90-...-diwali.webp",
      "isActive": true,
      "createdAt": "2026-07-27T10:22:41.660Z",
      "updatedAt": "2026-07-27T10:22:41.660Z"
    },
    {
      "id": "8a71d3b5-90ce-4c22-b7f4-1e5a9d0c3f77",
      "imageUrl": "https://cdn.unilake.example/hero-images/2c9f4e11-...-summer.png",
      "isActive": true,
      "createdAt": "2026-07-19T05:11:08.412Z",
      "updatedAt": "2026-07-19T05:11:08.412Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Empty state (`data: []`) is realistic and must be designed for.** No hero images = the carousel renders nothing. Decide now whether that means a static fallback banner or a collapsed section — do not ship a layout that leaves a blank full-bleed gap or an infinite skeleton.

**Errors:** none beyond a 500 if the DB is unreachable.

---

### 6.2 `GET /api/admin/hero-images` — list all

Every hero image, active and inactive, `createdAt` descending. No pagination, no filters — the whole table in one array. Filter client-side for an "active only" view.

Response shape is identical to §6.1 but includes rows with `"isActive": false`.

**Errors:** `401`, `403`.

> ⚠️ **`isActive` defaults to `true` — the opposite of announcements.** A hero image goes **live on the public homepage the instant step 5.3 completes.** There is no draft state and no way to pre-stage a banner. If the admin needs to prepare a banner without publishing it, the flow is: upload → then immediately toggle it off (§6.3). Build that as one action in the UI if the admins ask for staging, and make the "Upload" button copy say **"Upload & publish"** so nobody is surprised.

---

### 6.3 `PATCH /api/admin/hero-images/:id/status` — toggle active/inactive

**Path param:** `id`. **Request body: NONE.**

This is a **toggle, not a setter** — there is no `validateBody` on this route and the handler never reads `req.body`. Sending `{"isActive": false}` has no effect; the server flips the current value whatever it is.

```js
await fetch(`${BASE_URL}/api/admin/hero-images/${id}/status`, {
  method: "PATCH",
  credentials: "include",
  // no body, no Content-Type
});
```

Because it isn't idempotent, a double-click or a retry-on-timeout lands you back where you started. **Disable the switch while the request is in flight and render its state from the response**, not from optimistic local state.

**Response `200`:** the full row with `isActive` flipped.

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "id": "c4e91f07-3b52-4a8d-95c1-7d0f6b2e4a19",
    "imageUrl": "https://cdn.unilake.example/hero-images/6f2b1a90-...-diwali.webp",
    "isActive": false,
    "createdAt": "2026-07-27T10:22:41.660Z",
    "updatedAt": "2026-07-27T11:03:12.994Z"
  }
}
```

**Errors:** `404 NOT_FOUND` (`"Hero image not found"`), `401`, `403`.

---

### 6.4 `DELETE /api/admin/hero-images/:id` — delete

**Path param:** `id`. **Body:** none.

Hard delete of the DB row. No soft delete, no undo.

**Response `204 No Content` — empty body, no envelope.**

```js
const res = await fetch(`${BASE_URL}/api/admin/hero-images/${id}`, {
  method: "DELETE",
  credentials: "include",
});
if (res.status === 204) {
  // success — do NOT call res.json()
}
```

**Errors:** `404 NOT_FOUND` (`"Hero image not found"`), `401`, `403`. Error responses do carry a JSON body; only the 204 is empty.

> **Note:** deleting the row does **not** delete the file from R2 ([heroImage.service.ts:77-87](src/services/heroImage.service.ts#L77-L87)) — unlike CustomerReview and TeamMember, which do clean up. The image stays publicly reachable at its old URL forever. Practical consequences: (a) don't rely on delete to make an image inaccessible — if a banner must be taken down for legal or brand reasons, tell backend so the object gets removed manually; (b) any URL you cached will keep resolving after the row is gone, so drive the carousel off the API response, not off a stale local copy. Flagged to backend as a gap (§9).

## 7. Quick reference

| # | Method | Path | Auth | Body | Success |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `GET` | `/api/public/hero-images` | none | — | `200` → array (active only) |
| 2 | `POST` | `/api/admin/hero-images/upload-url` | admin | `{ fileName, contentType }` | `200` → `{ uploadUrl, key }` |
| 3 | `PUT` | `<uploadUrl>` *(goes to R2, not us)* | signature | raw file bytes | `200` → empty |
| 4 | `POST` | `/api/admin/hero-images` | admin | `{ imageKey }` | `201` → object |
| 5 | `GET` | `/api/admin/hero-images` | admin | — | `200` → array (all) |
| 6 | `PATCH` | `/api/admin/hero-images/:id/status` | admin | **none** | `200` → object |
| 7 | `DELETE` | `/api/admin/hero-images/:id` | admin | — | `204` → **empty** |

---

## 8. Open items raised with backend

Documented as current behavior above; these are known gaps, not things for frontend to work around silently:

1. **No R2 cleanup on delete** — deleted hero images leave orphaned public files. `CustomerReview` and `TeamMember` already do this cleanup; `HeroImage` does not.
2. **No update endpoint** — replacing a banner requires delete + re-upload.
3. **No `sortOrder`** — carousel order is locked to newest-first. If the admins want manual ordering, this needs the same `sortOrder` + reorder endpoint that announcements have.
4. **`imageKey` is not validated against R2** — a bad key silently creates a broken row.
5. **`isActive` defaults to `true`** with no way to create-as-draft, and the status route is a blind toggle rather than an idempotent setter.
6. **Debugging note:** if `imageUrl` ever comes back starting with `undefined/`, that's a missing `R2_PUBLIC_URL_BASE` env var on the server ([env.ts:50](src/config/env.ts#L50) — it's read but not in the required-vars check), not a frontend bug. Report it rather than trying to patch the URL client-side.

If any of 1–5 blocks the admin panel design, raise it — they're all small backend changes.

          10px from the board's top and bottom would be ~363px wide, wider than
          the board itself. So covers are centre-cropped (object-cover) to fill
          it: a 16:9 cover loses ~10% off each side, a square cover ~15% off its
          top and bottom.

          The bottom edge ends a few px below the tops of the duster and chalk
          box, so the image slides BEHIND them — see the chalk-tray overlay
